### Performance Analysis

* Precomputation performance
  * It is not real-time but fast enough to be used for interactive editting
  * The increase of execution time from 128x128 to 256x256 is very small. Probably the GPU is not saturated at that time.

* PBR vs. Blinn-Phong
  * PBR using IBL only
  * Blinn-Phong was tested using two point light sources
  * Framebuffer resolution was 1920x1080 with no AA
  * Bloom was on
  * The scene with a Cerberus pistol in it was used for benchmark
  * Basically no addtional cost by using PBR over Blinn-Phong but we get much better quality

### Build Instruction

* Install LunarG Vulkan SDK
* If you have Visual Studio 2015, the solution should build out of the box
* To run the program, you will need to copy the .dlls to executable path or system paths
* Builds on other platforms are not supported yet
